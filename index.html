        <p id="levip">Levi's obedience is strictly limited to individuals he respects, and he has no problem showing open disdain for authority from anyone outside of this circle. At Eren's tribunal, he insulted the merchants by calling them "pigs" and told the Military Police that they were not competent enough to handle Eren,[22] mocking several MPs by observing that they have never battled or even seen a single Titan. He even sardonically suggests that they join the Survey Corps, which caused them to back off. He openly resents most of the MPs for their continual attempts to undermine the Survey Corps, and also presumably because of the criminal life he led before he joined the Corps.</p>

   <p id="div">Levi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut curtain, as well as narrow, intimidating dull gray eyes with dark circles under them and a deceptively youthful face. He is quite short, but his physique is well-developed in musculature from extensive vertical maneuvering equipment usage. He is usually either frowning or expressionless; that, plus his extremely calm demeanor, often makes it difficult for others to guess what he is thinking.

        He is most often seen in his Survey Corps uniform, with a light gray button-up shirt underneath, along with his trademark white ascot. When embarking on expeditions outside the Walls, he also wears the Survey Corps' green hooded cloak. Once, when forced to take leave from his duties due to injury, Levi was seen in a black suit, plain white shirt, ascot, and dress shoes.[citation needed] However, since the beginning of the coup d'Ã©tat, he has left the ascot off. For most of the time during which the Survey Corps was on the run from the military and monarchy, he simply wore his vertical maneuvering equipment harness over casual clothes.[citation needed]
        
        After a close-encounter explosion from a Thunder Spear set off by Zeke Yeager,[18] Levi now has several scars across his face including one across his right eye and is missing both the index and middle fingers on his right hand.[19]</p>

            Eren is a teenager who swears revenge on enormous man-eating humanoid creatures known as Titans, 
            who have forced what remains of the human race to live in walled off cities and devoured his mother while destroying his home town in the Shiganshina district of Wall Maria. 
            In order to defeat the Titans, Eren enlists in the Military and joins the Survey Corps</pre></dd>
